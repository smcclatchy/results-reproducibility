:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- What are some common reasons for irreproducibility?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Describe a conceptual framework for reproducibility.
- Explain how and why adopting reproducible practices benefits research.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## P-value interpretation

## Batch effects
no randomization
with randomization still batch effects due to technician, time of day, weather,
or any other variable not under study that influence the study nevertheless.
Randomization balances out these other variables

## Small sample size and low power
cost per sample
statistical power is the power to detect a real effect if it exists

## solutions
open science - "as open as possible, as closed as necessary"
Reproducible research hinges on understanding how experiments were performed and how data was acquired 
Two critical elements to improve reproducibility: 
Increased transparency and sharing of research reagents, methods, and data
Accelerated sharing of results (preprints)
data sharing, code sharing, pre-registration of research
make a data sharing plan at the outset
parts of the data to share
1. The raw data
2. A tidy data set
3. A data dictionary describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set.
4. An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 -> 2,3

## Case 1: The gene set that characterizes early Alzheimer's disease 

K.Q. Watkins and coauthors describe a unique gene set characteristic of early
onset Alzheimer's Disease. The gene expression heatmap from their paper
clearly delineates Alzheimer's patients from a neurotypical control group. 

![heatmap of expression values](./fig/AD_expression_heatmap.png)

Watkins, K. Q., et al. (2022). A unique gene expression signature characterizes 
early Alzheimer's disease. _Nature Alzheimer's_, 33(3), 737-753.

Use the [R script](./code/AD_heatmap.R), the [data](./data/expr_matrix.csv), and 
the [metadata](./data/expr_metadata.csv) to reproduce this plot. 

Can you find other ways to present the (meta)data in the heatmap? 
What do alternate ways of presenting the data show you?

This is a simulated study and publication. Any resemblance to real persons or 
real studies is purely coincidental.

:::::::::::::::  solution

## Solution to Case 1

1. You can replace `Diagnosis` with `Batch` in the call the `pheatmap`.

```r
pheatmap(expr_matrix, 
         annotation_col = metadata["Batch"], 
         fontsize_row   = 5)
```

This will show the same heatmap, though in this one the legend shows batch 
number instead of disease state. This is an example of complete confounding
between batch and diagnosis. All of the Alzheimer's samples were run in 
the first batch and all of the controls in the second. There is no way to
disentangle disease state from batch. 

The graphic below shows an example of complete confounding at right under
`Can't Be Corrected`. Batch 1 contains only controls and batch 2 only disease
samples. There is no method that will be able to discern the effect of the batch
from the effect of disease or control. 

Batch effects are common and can be corrected if samples are randomized to 
batch. At left beneath `Can Be Corrected`, control and disease samples were 
randomized to each of three batches. There can still be batch effects, however,
there are methods available (e.g. `ComBat`) that can correct for these effects.

## Case 2: Hippocampal volume reduction in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)

K.Z. Smith and coauthors describe hippocampal volume loss in subjects with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). The boxplots below show a clear difference in
hippocampal volume between the MCI and control groups. 

![heatmap of expression values](./fig/boxplots.png)

Smith, K. Z., et al. (2023). Hippocampal volume loss in mild cognitive 
impairment. _Science Progress_, 3(14), 37-53.

A t-test gave a p-value of less than 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis of no 
difference in means between the two groups. The boxplots appear to back up this
assertion.

1. Use the [R script](./code/t_test.R) and the 
[data](./data/small_sample_data.csv) to reproduce the boxplot and t-test. 

2. Create a scatterplot of the data by group to get further insight. You can
also look at the entire dataset to get a sense of it.  

3. Calculate the effect size between the two groups.

```r
# Estimate effect size (Cohen's d for hippocampal volume)
library(effsize)
d_result <- cohen.d(HippocampalVolume ~ Group, data = data)
print(d_result)
```

4. Use the effect size to calculate statistical power. 

```r
# Estimate power for hippocampal volume
# Using observed effect size 
library(pwr)
power_result <- pwr.t.test(
  d = d_result$estimate,
  n = n_per_group,
  sig.level = 0.05,
  type = "two.sample",
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
print(power_result)
```

5. What sample size (`n_per_group`) would have resulted in 80% statistical power 
for this experiment?

This is a simulated study and publication. Any resemblance to real persons or 
real studies is purely coincidental.

## Solution to Case 2

1. 
```r
t_test_result <- t.test(HippocampalVolume ~ Group, data = data)
print(t_test_result)

boxplot(HippocampalVolume ~ Group, data = data, main = "Hippocampal Volume", 
        ylab = "Volume (cmÂ³)")
```

2. 
```r
data %>% ggplot(aes(Group, HippocampalVolume)) + geom_point()
```

3. 
```r
# Estimate effect size (Cohen's d for hippocampal volume)
library(effsize)
d_result <- cohen.d(HippocampalVolume ~ Group, data = data)
print(d_result)
```

```output
Cohen's d

d estimate: -1.558649 (large)
95 percent confidence interval:
     lower      upper 
-3.2238802  0.1065818
```

4. 
```r
# Estimate power for hippocampal volume
# Using observed effect size 
library(pwr)
power_result <- pwr.t.test(
  d = d_result$estimate,
  n = n_per_group,
  sig.level = 0.05,
  type = "two.sample",
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
print(power_result)
```

```output
     Two-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 5
              d = 1.558649
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.581064
    alternative = two.sided

NOTE: n is number in *each* group
```

5.
```r
# Update sample size to 8
n_per_group <- 8

# Estimate power for hippocampal volume
# Using observed effect size 
power_result <- pwr.t.test(
  d = d_result$estimate,
  n = n_per_group,
  sig.level = 0.05,
  type = "two.sample",
  alternative = "two.sided"
)
print(power_result)
```

```output
     Two-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 8
              d = 1.558649
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.8258431
    alternative = two.sided

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Reproducibility has many definitions.
- We define reproducibility here as using the same data and methods as the original study.
- Adopting reproducible practices strengthens science and makes it more rigorous.
